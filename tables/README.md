# Tables Folder

Here we save the initial configuration of the table(s)
This allows to get the information like:
 * Table name
 * Table columns
 * Columns datatypes
 * Transformation to be done
 * Primary Key
 * Drop table

 The option to drop the table isn't available yet. But this feature allow to drop and recreate the table in case it is needed.
